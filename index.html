       Hey Mac! Thanks for coming to talk to our class, I will say you are a great speaker and I loved the open discussion mixed into your presentation, keeping us all engaged. I was curious if your team is all on site, hybrid, or remote due to the platform you guys have created? I wanted to know more about your team setup, if you guys ever thought about hiring freelancers for certain projects? I would love to stay connected and maybe even set up an informative interview to hear more about Sketchbox!\n
