       Thank you for giving us an idea on how the simulations are constructed! I would be interested in doing a little something along the lines of this. I think it would make more sense to use the Unreal Engine.-David Egan; color:white; width:3">

       Hey Mac! Thanks for coming to talk to our class, I will say you are a great speaker and I loved the open discussion mixed into your presentation, keeping us all engaged. I was curious if your team is all on site, hybrid, or remote due to the platform you guys have created? I wanted to know more about your team setup, if you guys ever thought about hiring freelancers for certain projects? I would love to stay connected and maybe even set up an informative interview to hear more about Sketchbox! Thanks once again - Jason Salazar Tobar ; color:white; width:3">
